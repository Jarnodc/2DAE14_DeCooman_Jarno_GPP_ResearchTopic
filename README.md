A bot that plays [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) using AI [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

## Description
### How?
I am trying to make simple chess game in Unity where you can play to a bot that is controlled through a self-written AI. The technique, I am going to use is MiniMax. MiniMax is a version of AI where the program creates a kind of search tree of all possible moves starting with your own moves and then the opponent's moves on top of yours and so on. Each move has a score and in this way the best move can be determined. The move must have the highest possible score for your own move and the smallest possible score for the opponent's move.
